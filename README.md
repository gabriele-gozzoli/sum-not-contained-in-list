## Sum not contained in list

Given a list of integers, check if the sum of any two integers in the list is not contained in the list.

For example with the list [4, 5, 15, 2, 8], there is no pair of integers where their sum is in the list.

The list [8, 7, 5, 3] does not satisfy the criteria since the sum of 5 and 3 is in the list.

Write a function which takes a list of integers and returns True if the list satisfies the criteria above,
or False otherwise.
